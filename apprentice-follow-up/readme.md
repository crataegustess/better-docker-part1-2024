# Follow Up Assessment Questions

As part of the apprenticeship it's important to measure how much you have learned after a training course, and how much that learning can be applied.

Take a few days after the taining to let things sink in and then tackle the questions in the question markdown sheet. Update the question sheet to include your answers and commit & push the changes to get them checked.
